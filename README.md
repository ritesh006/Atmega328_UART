# UART Communication with AVR Microcontroller

This repository contains code for implementing UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication using an AVR microcontroller. UART is a popular communication protocol for serial communication between devices.

## Code Overview

- `main.c`: This file contains the main program implementing UART communication. It initializes UART, transmits the character 'A' repeatedly with a delay, and echoes back any received characters.
- `uart.h`: Header file containing function prototypes for UART initialization, transmission, and reception.
- `util/delay.h`: Library for adding delays.

## How to Use

To use this code:

1. Connect your AVR microcontroller to a computer using a USB-to-serial adapter or any other UART interface.
2. Compile the code using an AVR toolchain (e.g., AVR-GCC).
3. Upload the compiled binary to your AVR microcontroller.
4. Open a serial terminal (e.g., PuTTY, Minicom) on your computer and configure it to match the baud rate and other settings used in the code.
5. You should see the character 'A' being transmitted repeatedly, and any characters you type in the terminal should be echoed back.

## Pin Configuration

Make sure to configure the RX and TX pins of your AVR microcontroller appropriately to connect to the corresponding RX and TX pins of your UART interface.

## Dependencies

This code depends on the AVR Libc library for AVR-specific functions and definitions. Make sure to have AVR Libc installed and properly configured in your development environment.
